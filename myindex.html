      <h2>Hello.....</h2>
      <p>This is Muminur. I'm a real estate professional in Florida, USA.
        I especially focus on commercial real estate but sometimes I don't mind residential or renting deals.
        I completed my graduation in Business with major-Management but I also have a passion for web development and programming. That's why recently I started working on different web development projects.  
        To me, every single skill or effort end up with doing some kind of business. I do love to get involved in the business.
        Also, I believe doing business is in my nature.
                 I love wholesale and export-import business.🤔</p>
